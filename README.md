# Better Uptime Bot

Better Uptime is a monitoring service for websites, cronjobs, etc.
It works great, but with the free version I can only receive notifications via emails which is anoying. Since I'm in the process of learning Python, I thought I might as well code something useful.

So here is the plan:
I connected the program to my email account, and when it receives a new mail from Better Uptime, it downloads that email, filters all the informarmations and store it in a database. Then a discord bot notifies me of the alert in a channel in my personnal server.

The bot is still in  developement but I'm on the right path.
